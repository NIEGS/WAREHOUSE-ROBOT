Class Robot_wheels:
    - Variables:
        - wheel1 (Transform of the first wheel)
        - wheel2 (Transform of the second wheel)
        - wheel3 (Transform of the third wheel)
        - wheel4 (Transform of the fourth wheel)
        - robot (reference to the Robot instance)
        - speed1 (speed of the first wheel)
        - speed2 (speed of the second wheel)
        - speed3 (speed of the third wheel)
        - speed4 (speed of the fourth wheel)
        - stop (whether the wheels should stop or not)
        - forward_rotate (direction of rotation: true for forward, false for rotate)

    Function Start:
        - Initialization code (currently empty)

    Function goForward(speed):
        - Set all wheel speeds to -20 * speed
        - Set forward_rotate to true
        - Set stop to false

    Function rotate(speed):
        - Set speed1 and speed2 to -3 * speed
        - Set speed3 and speed4 to 3 * speed
        - Set forward_rotate to false
        - Set stop to false

    Function Update:
        - If the robot is not in PickingUp state and the wheels are not stopped:
            - If moving forward or rotating, rotate each wheel based on its speed and delta time
